# Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the tissue 
at the back of the eye (retina). Poorly controlled blood sugar is a risk factor.
Early symptoms include floaters, blurriness, dark areas of vision and difficulty
perceiving colours. Blindness can occur.
